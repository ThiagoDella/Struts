# Struts [WIP]
Struts is a simple library for data structures in JavaScript (NodeJS).
It has been created as part of my studies about this subject and as a way to fill my needs of coding.

### How to use it
For now you should manually download <b>Struts</b> from this repository and save it on your dependency folder.

In your code, you can just require it:

```javascript
const struts = require('./path/struts.js');
```

## Data Structures
Here you will find the documentation for this library.

### List
A simple implementation of a list.

<b><i>struts.list.initEmpty(size)</i></b>


| Variable      | Type          | Explanation  |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| size      | Integer | defines a size for an empty list |
